A project in which I am implementing a telegram bot that optimally schedules certain tasks for each day using special algorithms.
It works with a list of tasks that have the following parameters: interest, time, obligation and deadline.
For all days, the standard amount of time per day to perform tasks from this list is defined in the settings, but for better customization, the working time can be defined for each day separately. 

I made the basis of the bot when I had a huge number of tasks and didn't know how to schedule them properly.
He really helped me)))))
